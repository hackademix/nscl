## Integration

Add this repository as a **[Git Submodule]** and integrate <br>
the  [`include.sh`]  script into your build workflow.

<br>
<br>

## Why

As **Google** is imposing **[Manifest V3]** on *chromium-based browsers* <br>
and **Mozilla** may comply and downgrade their **WebExtensions API** <br>
for compatibility sake as well, developers now have to struggle with <br>
the limited tool-set that remains.

*This library tries to alleviate some of these problems.*

<br>
<br>

## Mobile

This library is also useful in the aspect of porting / maintaining extension <br>
for mobile browser, such as the  `Fenix`  Android browser, considering <br>
that often only a small subset of the desktop **APIs** are supported.

<br>
<br>

## Details

By abstracting the common functionality shared among security and privacy extensions, <br>
providing consistent implementations across multiple browser engines and shielding <br>
developers from the browser-dependent implementation details (which precisely in <br>
the most optimistic scenario, i.e. Firefox keeping its WebExtensions API as powerful <br>
as it is, are doomed to diverge dramatically), this library aims to minimize the added <br>
maintenance burden and mitigate the danger of introducing new, insidious bugs <br>
and security vulnerabilities due to features mismatches and multiple code paths.

Cross-browser issues have a chance to be fixed / worked around in single place, <br>
ideally with the help of multiple developers sharing the same requirements.

The solutions will be subject to automated tests to timely catch regressions, <br>
especially those caused by further changes in the different browser APIs.

The residual browser-specific differences, compromises and corner cases <br>
which couldn't be addressed at all, or without significant performance <br>
penalties, are clearly bench marked and documented, to make both <br>
developers and users well aware of the limitations imposed by each <br>
browser and capable of educated decisions, tailored to their <br>
security and privacy needs.

This transparency should pressure browser vendors into <br>
increasing their support level, when they're publicly shown <br>
to be measurably lacking in comparison to their competitors.

<br>
<br>
